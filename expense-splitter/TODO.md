some reminder for myself (Predrag)

- try to extract modal logic into a custom hook
- simplify GroupMembers.jsx by making members automatically wrap inside container so that you can remove "view all" btn
- replace icons in Total budget/Total expense/Remaining budget cards to be empty not filled, and replace the bugged shopping cart icon with something else
- add an id to each member so that if they have the same, when you delete one, it will not happen that both get deleted
