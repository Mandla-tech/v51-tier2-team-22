some reminder for myself (Predrag)

- try to extract modal logic into a custom hook
- simplify GroupMembers.jsx by making members automatically wrap inside container so that you can remove "view all" btn
- replace icons in Total budget/Total expense/Remaining budget cards to be empty not filled, and replace the bugged shopping cart icon with something else
- see with Fari to make array of colors that look nice and are the same theme, like sand colors or something. this is for the chart colors on groups page
- inside GroupMembers.jsx make it so that member cards will wrap automatically and the container expands downwards automatically. for some reason, this is not the case right now by default. member cards should not overflow outside the container
