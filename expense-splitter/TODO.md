some reminders for myself (Predrag)

- try to extract modal logic into a custom hook
- replace icons in Total budget/Total expense/Remaining budget cards to be empty not filled, and replace the bugged shopping cart icon with something else

MINOR

- check whether DarkModeToggle.jsx toggle functionality can be written in more declarative way
- [IN PROGRESS] see with Fari to make array of colors that look nice and are the same theme, like sand colors or something. this is for the chart colors on groups page
- inside GroupMembers.jsx make a bg change on hover
